# SyncSpeaker Server Configuration

# Server Port
PORT=8080

# Redis Configuration (REQUIRED for production)
# For Railway/production deployment, use REDIS_URL (automatically set by Railway Redis plugin)
# REDIS_URL=redis://default:password@host:port

# For local development, use individual Redis settings (defaults to localhost:6379)
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
# REDIS_PASSWORD=your-password-here  # Uncomment if using password auth

# Notes:
# - In production (Railway): REDIS_URL is REQUIRED and set automatically by the Redis plugin
# - In development: REDIS_HOST defaults to localhost:6379 with no password
# - If Redis is not configured, the server will log a warning and party creation will fail
# - The /health endpoint shows Redis connection status: "connected", "missing", or "error"
