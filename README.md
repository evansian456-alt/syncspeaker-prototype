# syncspeaker-prototype
Browser prototype for SyncSpeaker

## Theme

The SyncSpeaker UI features a DJ-themed design with:
- **Dark neon gradient background** with purple, blue, and pink accents
- **Glassmorphism cards** with backdrop blur effects for a modern, translucent look
- **DJ header graphic** showing an inline SVG turntable with headphones, featuring a subtle animated glow
- **Animated equalizer** with 10 bars that respond to playback state (faster when playing, slower when paused)
- **Background accents** with 3 floating blurred gradient blobs for visual depth

All visuals are created with inline SVG and CSS animations - no external libraries or copyrighted images.

## Running the prototype

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
