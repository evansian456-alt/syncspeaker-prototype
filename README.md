## Getting Started

### Quick Start (Browser-Only Mode)

For **single-device testing** without installing dependencies:

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or
2. Use Python's built-in HTTP server:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   # Then open http://localhost:8080
   ```

**Browser-Only Features:**
- ✅ Landing page and UI testing
- ✅ Create party (local/offline mode)
- ✅ Music file selection and playback
- ✅ Party Pass activation (simulated)
- ✅ Single-device party experience

**Limitations in Browser-Only Mode:**
- ❌ Multi-device sync (requires server)
- ❌ Join party from other devices
- ❌ WebSocket real-time updates

### Full Installation (Multi-Device Mode)

For **multi-device testing** with real-time sync:

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Redis server (required for multi-instance party discovery)

#### Redis Setup
See [REDIS_SETUP.md](REDIS_SETUP.md) for detailed installation and configuration instructions.

Quick start:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server

# macOS
brew install redis
brew services start redis

# Docker
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine
```

#### Server Setup
```bash
npm install
npm start
# or for development
npm run dev
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`

**Full Server Features:**
- ✅ All browser-only features
- ✅ Multi-device party sync
- ✅ Join party from other devices
- ✅ WebSocket real-time updates
- ✅ Party state management
- ✅ Cross-instance party discovery (via Redis)

#### Configuration
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customize if needed:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Default configuration connects to Redis at `localhost:6379`. See [REDIS_SETUP.md](REDIS_SETUP.md) for production configuration.

## Testing

This project includes a comprehensive test suite for server-side functions and utilities.

### Running Tests
