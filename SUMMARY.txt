                    WHY YOU CAN'T MERGE THIS BRANCH
================================================================================

PROBLEM #1: UNRELATED HISTORIES (Grafted Branch)
------------------------------------------------
Error: fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories

The branch was created with "grafted" commits - no connection to main.
Git refuses to merge branches with no common ancestor.


PROBLEM #2: OUTDATED CODE  
------------------------
The branch is based on OLD code from before PR #125 was merged.
Main already has sync improvements (PR #125 merged at commit 363fcae).

Merging would OVERWRITE newer code with older code = BAD!


WHAT'S IN THIS BRANCH?
-----------------------
CODE CHANGES (conflicts with main):
  - app.js: -1,145 lines removed
  - server.js: -423 lines removed  
  - Deleted: sync.test.js, tier-enforcement.test.js

DOCUMENTATION (safe to add):
  - SYNC_IMPLEMENTATION.md
  - SYNC_TESTING_GUIDE.md
  - MERGE_RECOMMENDATION.md
  - FINAL_MERGE_READINESS.md
  - MERGE_ANSWER.md
  - MERGE_BLOCKER_FIX.md
  - COMPLETE_MERGE_ANALYSIS.md
  - WHY_CANT_MERGE.md


THE SOLUTION
------------
✅ Extract ONLY the documentation (code already in main via PR #125)

Commands:
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git checkout -b add-merge-docs
  
  git checkout copilot/fix-sync-reliability -- *.md
  
  git add *.md
  git commit -m "docs: Add merge and sync documentation"
  git push origin add-merge-docs

Then create PR from add-merge-docs → main


DON'T DO THIS
-------------
❌ git merge copilot/fix-sync-reliability --allow-unrelated-histories
   (This would merge outdated code and cause conflicts!)
